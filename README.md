## About

This repository contains Firebase Firestore (Cloud Firestore) database for a Responsive Login Form. It demonstrates the integration of Firebase Firestore with both JavaScript and C# applications, showcasing how to perform CRUD operations with a remote database in a front-end context.

## Key Features

- **Responsive Login Form**: A user interface that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
- **Firebase Firestore Integration**: Demonstrates how to connect and interact with a Firestore database.
- **CRUD Operations**: Includes examples for creating, reading, updating, and deleting documents in Firestore.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have a [Google account](https://accounts.google.com/).
- You have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for the JavaScript demo).
- You have installed [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (for the C# demo).
- You have set up a Firebase project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

## Installation

### Firebase Setup

1. **Create a Firebase Project:**

   - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Click on "Add project" and follow the setup instructions.
   - Enable Firestore in your Firebase project.

2. **Configure Firestore Rules:**

Firestore security rules control the access to your Firestore database. By default, Firestore databases start in locked mode, meaning no one can read or write to the database. For development and testing purposes, you might want to relax these rules to allow read and write access to anyone. Hereâ€™s how to set up Firestore rules to allow read and write access.
